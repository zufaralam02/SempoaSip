/**
 * This class defines an ExpandableListView which supports animations for
 * collapsing and expanding groups.
 */
public class ExpandableListViewAnimated extends ExpandableListView {
	/*
	 * A detailed explanation for how this class works:
	 * 
	 * Animating the ExpandableListView was no easy task. The way that this
	 * class does it is by exploiting how an ExpandableListView works.
	 * 
	 * Normally when {@link ExpandableListView#collapseGroup(int)} or
	 * {@link ExpandableListView#expandGroup(int)} is called, the view toggles
	 * the flag for a group and calls notifyDataSetChanged to cause the ListView
	 * to refresh all of it's view. This time however, depending on whether a
	 * group is expanded or collapsed, certain childViews will either be ignored
	 * or added to the list.
	 * 
	 * Knowing this, we can come up with a way to animate our views. For
	 * instance for group expansion, we tell the adapter to animate the
	 * children of a certain group. We then expand the group which causes the
	 * ExpandableListView to refresh all views on screen. The way that
	 * ExpandableListView does this is by calling getView() in the adapter.
	 * However since the adapter knows that we are animating a certain group,
	 * instead of returning the real views for the children of the group being
	 * animated, it will return a fake dummy view. This dummy view will then
	 * draw the real child views within it's dispatchDraw function. The reason
	 * we do this is so that we can animate all of it's children by simply
	 * animating the dummy view. After we complete the animation, we tell the
	 * adapter to stop animating the group and call notifyDataSetChanged. Now
	 * the ExpandableListView is forced to refresh it's views again, except this
	 * time, it will get the real views for the expanded group.
	 * 
	 * So, to list it all out, when {@link #expandGroupWithAnimation(int)} is
	 * called the following happens:
	 * 
	 * 1. The ExpandableListView tells the adapter to animate a certain group.
	 * 2. The ExpandableListView calls expandGroup.
	 * 3. ExpandGroup calls notifyDataSetChanged.
	 * 4. As an result, getChildView is called for expanding group.
	 * 5. Since the adapter is in "animating mode", it will return a dummy view.
	 * 6. This dummy view draws the actual children of the expanding group.
	 * 7. This dummy view's height is animated from 0 to it's expanded height.
	 * 8. Once the animation completes, the adapter is notified to stop
	 * animating the group and notifyDataSetChanged is called again.
	 * 9. This forces the ExpandableListView to refresh all of it's views again.
	 * 10.This time when getChildView is called, it will return the actual
	 * child views.
	 * 
	 * For animating the collapse of a group is a bit more difficult since we
	 * can't call collapseGroup from the start as it would just ignore the
	 * child items, giving up no chance to do any sort of animation. Instead
	 * what we have to do is play the animation first and call collapseGroup
	 * after the animation is done.
	 * 
	 * So, to list it all out, when {@link #collapseGroupWithAnimation(int)} is
	 * called the following happens:
	 * 
	 * 1. The ExpandableListView tells the adapter to animate a certain group.
	 * 2. The ExpandableListView calls notifyDataSetChanged.
	 * 3. As an result, getChildView is called for expanding group.
	 * 4. Since the adapter is in "animating mode", it will return a dummy view.
	 * 5. This dummy view draws the actual children of the expanding group.
	 * 6. This dummy view's height is animated from it's current height to 0.
	 * 7. Once the animation completes, the adapter is notified to stop
	 * animating the group and notifyDataSetChanged is called again.
	 * 8. collapseGroup is finally called.
	 * 9. This forces the ExpandableListView to refresh all of it's views again.
	 * 10.This time when the ListView will not get any of the child views for
	 * the collapsed group.
